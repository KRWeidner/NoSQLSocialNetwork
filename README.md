# NoSQL SocialNetwork

## Description
This app is meant to showcase our NoSQL knowledge utilizing mongoose DB and express server through a Social Network Database.
The walkthrough video will demonstrate how we start the DB server and how to get/post/put/delete from our database schemas by using insomnia to pass api calls we set up.

## Useage
This app creates 2 models or DB tables we created: User, and Thought as the basis for our DB. User contains basic user info and Thought contains text people would post along with reactions.
Using these tables, we can test making api calls to retrieve or edit the data in those tables.
